# SimTwo Autonomous Robot Project 
SimTwo Project (Pascal Language)


This work is part of a Dissertation presented to the School of Technology and Management of Bragan√ßa to obtain the Master Degree in Industrial Engineering in 2020. 

The main goal is to developer a control system for an autonomous vehicle that provides autonomous driving. For this, a simulation software, named "SimTwo" was used, where the actuation and sensing model was developed. SimTwo is a realistic simulator where several types of robots can be implemented. 

At the end of the work, a control and 3D visualization system was obtained for an autonomous vehicle capable of driving on a road, avoiding obstacles, alerting in case of danger, among others. The work was developed in a simulation environment and includes a 3D model of a road, with several real scenarios, where the vehicle moves. This can be driven by a user (as if it was a game) or switched on autonomous driving/help mode. There are objects on the circuit that can obstruct the passage of the car, creating situations of imminent danger. This system alerts the driver in the event of danger and reacts by deflecting or stopping. This control system uses image sensors and LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) as inputs data sources.

Please use SimTwo2020CAM.exe for CAMERA sensor operation (Ctrl+A once the simulator is open).
